# Who am I?

I'm a data scientist with 5+ years of industry experience ranging from small startups to a big Fortune 500 corporation.  Before taking up data science, I [did physics](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/742/2/75/pdf) at MIT and at UC Santa Cruz.

I work primarily in Python and various SQL dialects, and think Scala is pretty neat.

When my computer lets me out for some fresh air, I enjoy rock climbing, trying to stay fit, Making Things (TM), and contemplating the power and beauty of well designed abstraction boundaries.
